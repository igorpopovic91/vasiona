My native language is Serbian, which all of my family members speak. When I was 9 years old I started learning English and Russian in school and now I can say I am fluent in those languages too. Why Russian and English at the same time, well one intresting thing in Serbian language is that we have two alphabets: Cyrilic and Latin and we used them respectfully. So learning Russian wasn't so hard for me to learn. Also, I speak and write in German, though just some simple sentences. I found out the best way to learn a foreign language is through reading and communication with native speakers in that language.
